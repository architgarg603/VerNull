# Description:

## Our application is lordosis prevention with an asthenopia monitoring partner for your daily desktop. The user will be notified of a prognosis on the dashboard, along with promoting resources for the users to check out such as videos created by health professionals and articles published by trustworthy resources to teach them how to fix their posture over time. We will provide them an analysis of the posture and notify the end users according to the areas of improvement. This will be automated on the desktop and the user need not login to dashboard. To engage our users, we offer a plethora of rewards to continue with a good posture.  To prevent the user from eye strain, we provide constant reminders to take twenty seconds break after every twenty minutes work  according to the 20-20 rule.  For reducing eye strain, checking for proper lighting at the employee desk is what our model will check and will advise to adjust the brightness of the computer screen.

## Some features of this project are -
- Posture Detection
- Emotion Detection
- Screen Distance Detection
- Reward System using Cryptocurrency
- Resources to stay fit.

## Future Plan
We are planning to collaborate with cult.fit to provide our users with personalized exercises. To improve the accessibility of our model by detecting side poses. Improvising our plans with some exciting features is a thing we are taking in consideration for future scope. 

## How we build
Our desktop application captures a video screening test using the userâ€™s webcam- once they allow access- to detect the posture of the user at particular intervals. The development of Vernull was split in two parts. The interface, and the backend. Starting with the interface, it was designed in Figma with the logo designed in Adobe Photoshop. The colors picked for the interface are soft neutrals and in the shades of skin as Spine is supposed to be used by people all ages and backgrounds while promoting self-care.  The fronthend hosting is done by Spheron and authentication is provided by thirdWeb.  For contracts, we have used Polygon and Lighthouse for file storage. The model for detecting posture has been trained using the TensorFlow node module and Machine learning teachable machine tools. The frontend technologies also includes Velo by Wix, spheron and electron.
